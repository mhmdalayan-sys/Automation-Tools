FastRecon – Automated Attack Surface Mapping Tool

📌 Overview

FastRecon is a lightweight automation script designed to assist security practitioners, students, and defenders in performing initial reconnaissance and attack surface mapping for web-facing assets.

The tool chains together well-known open-source utilities to quickly identify:
-Exposed subdomains
-Live hosts
-Common web services and ports
-Potential web vulnerabilities (via template-based scanning)

FastRecon is intended strictly for authorized environments, such as:
-Personal labs
-Training platforms (e.g. TryHackMe, Hack The Box)
-Bug bounty programs
-Internal security assessments

🎯 Purpose & Use Case

During real-world assessments, reconnaissance often involves repetitive manual steps:
-Enumerating subdomains
-Checking which hosts are alive
-Identifying common web services
-Creating web targets for further testing

FastRecon automates this early recon phase, allowing analysts to:
-Save time
-Reduce human error
-Focus on analysis instead of setup

This tool does not perform exploitation — it only gathers and organizes publicly accessible information.

🧠 How It Works

FastRecon follows a clear, staged workflow:

1️⃣ Subdomain Enumeration

Uses assetfinder to discover subdomains related to the target domain

Results are deduplicated and stored for later stages

2️⃣ Live Host Detection

Checks discovered subdomains for open HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) ports

Filters out inactive or unreachable hosts

3️⃣ Common Port Scanning

Scans a small, focused list of common web ports:

80, 443, 8080, 8000, 8443, 3000

Uses nmap with conservative timing to minimize noise

4️⃣ Web Target Construction

Builds valid http:// and https:// URLs based on open ports

Produces a clean list of web targets for further inspection

5️⃣ Visual Recon (Optional Context)

Uses gowitness to capture screenshots of discovered web services

Helps analysts quickly identify login panels, dashboards, or APIs

6️⃣ Template-Based Vulnerability Scanning

Runs nuclei using community HTTP templates

Focuses only on:
-critical
-high
-medium severity findings

No intrusive or exploit-based templates are used

7️⃣ Structured Reporting

Outputs both human-readable files and a JSON report

Makes results easy to parse, share, or integrate into other tools

📂 Output Structure
results/
└── target.com/
    ├── subdomains.txt
    ├── alive.txt
    ├── hosts.txt
    ├── ports.txt
    ├── web.txt
    ├── nuclei.txt
    ├── report.json
    └── screens/


report.json consolidates all findings into a single structured file

Ideal for documentation, analysis, or automation pipelines

🛠 Tools Used

FastRecon integrates trusted open-source tools commonly used in security operations:

assetfinder – Subdomain discovery

netcat (nc) – Lightweight connectivity checks

nmap – Port scanning

gowitness – Web screenshotting

nuclei – Template-based vulnerability detection

Each tool is used in a non-intrusive, read-only manner.

⚠️ Ethical & Legal Notice

This tool is intended for authorized security testing only.
Do not scan systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test
Respect scope definitions in bug bounty programs
Follow applicable laws and organizational policies
The author assumes no liability for misuse of this tool.

🚀 Future Improvements

Planned or possible enhancements:
Configurable port lists
Rate limiting controls per module
Optional DNS resolution instead of TCP checks
Markdown/HTML report generation
Integration with additional passive recon tools

🧪 Learning Value

FastRecon was built as a learning-focused automation project, reinforcing:
Recon methodology
Tool chaining
Python scripting for security workflows
Clean result organization
