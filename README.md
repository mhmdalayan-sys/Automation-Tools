# Automation-Tools

A collection of **custom-built security automation tools** developed to support **penetration testing and defensive security workflows** in **authorized, simulated lab environments**.

This repository serves as a personal **learning and research workspace**, focusing on automating repetitive security tasks while reinforcing core concepts in:
- Reconnaissance
- Asset discovery
- Surface mapping
- Tool chaining
- Security workflow design

All tools are designed with **ethical use, transparency, and controlled environments** in mind.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this repository is to:

- Build **small, focused automation tools** from scratch  
- Improve efficiency during **early security assessment phases**  
- Practice writing clean, maintainable security-oriented scripts  
- Understand how real-world tools are chained together in practice  

These tools are intended for:
- Personal labs  
- Security training platforms (TryHackMe, Hack The Box, etc.)  
- Capture-the-Flag environments  
- Authorized internal testing

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

Each tool in this repository follows a few core principles:

- **Automation over repetition**  
- **Read-only reconnaissance before exploitation**  
- **Minimal assumptions about the target**  
- **Clear output and structured results**  
- **Integration of trusted open-source tools**  

The focus is not on exploitation, but on **information gathering, visibility, and analysis**.
